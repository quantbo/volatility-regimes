<h1>Volatility Regimes</h1>
<p>Finance theory advises that we pay attention to the volatility of a financial asset. There is a huge literature on volatility with notable contributions by Robert Shiller ("Market Volatility") and Robert Haugen (inventor of the low volatility strategy). It is definitely good to pay attention to volatility. But it is also good to be aware that the volatility of an asset can change radically over time. The Thai Baht provides an illustration of this phenonmenon.</p>
<h2>Very Low, Very High, Moderate</h2>
<p>As shown above, the Thai Baht / US Dollar exchange rate appears to have gone through three volatility regimes since the beginning of 1981:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Very Low</b>: Until 1997-July-02 the Baht was pegged to the US Dollar (according to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_baht' target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>).</li>
  <li><b>Very High</b>: During the Asian Currency Crisis, which began in Thailand, the peg to the US Dollar was broken and the exchange rate shot up, exhibiting high volatility. It is interesting to note that right before it shot up the Baht shot down a bit, probably due to an attempt by the Thai Central Bank to defend the currency.</li>
  <li><b>Moderate</b>: Since the Asian currency crisis the Baht floats freely against the Dollar and the exchange rate exhibits moderate volatility.</li>
</ul>
<p>The abrupt shift from very low to very high volatility in 1997 is an example of the principle put forth by Hegel that "everything conceals its opposite". Apparent serenity can conceal massive risk. This was also seen in the Western economic system, which shifted abruptly from the "Great Moderation" to the Financial Crisis of 2007-2009 and its aftermath. The Financial Crisis did not have much of an adverse effect on the Asian economies; evidently they had learned the lessons of 1997-8 and installed effective buffers.</p>
<h2>Fear very low volatility</h2>
<p>One lesson that might be drawn from the above is that moderate volatility may be safer than very low volatility. When things are very smooth it may be because adverse forces are being repressed, or even that there is fraud. The latter case applies to the Bernie Madoff ponzi scheme, which purported to provide very steady returns. The problem is that investors love very low volatility. Perhaps they should learn to fear very low volatility as much as very high volatility.</p>
